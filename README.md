# The Gourmet Mod

This mod ports the foods of Minecraft and adds tasty recipes for you to try!

## Made for 7.2 prerelease 2

I will try to update this mod to 7.2 proper once it's released.

## What do you plan to add?

For now I simply added all the animal foods from basic Minecraft (steak, mutton etc) and made them collectible on their respective animals.
Soon I plan to add the melon as well as recipes. Stay tuned.
